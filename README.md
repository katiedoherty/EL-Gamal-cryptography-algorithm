### How to run the code

 in the terminal.
 2. then enter the sender message who has sent an encrypted message to the person that holds the public key. for example enter: 6727 5767
 3. then enter the DES digits for example enter: 43, 70, -30, -26, -103, -113, -79, -99, 36, -80, 20, -75, -94, 22, -63, -13
